# Flatiron Fight - Frontend

Flatiron Fight is a game made with React that highlights the members of the Flatiron 4/20/2020 cohort and their amusing personalities. A user can select a character inspired by a cohort member, and use custom abilities to fight through the 'Flatiron Mods' in order to reach 'Mod 5' and face off against a Flatiron instructor.

## Motivation

We wanted to create a game that memorialized our cohort and the fun things we learned about eachother along the way.
